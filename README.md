# Social Network API

## Description

This project is a **RESTful API** backend built with **Express.js** and **MongoDB** for a social network application. It allows you to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) users, thoughts, and reactions (replies to thoughts). Users can also manage a friends list, and thoughts can have reactions from other users. The API is designed to handle complex relationships between users, thoughts, and reactions while maintaining a clean and scalable architecture.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the required Node.js packages listed in the `package.json` file.

---

## Usage

1. Start the server by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

   This will build and run the server. By default, the server will listen on `http://localhost:3000`.

2. Use an API testing tool like **Insomnia** or **Postman** to interact with the API. You can import the provided Insomnia environment file (if available) to quickly get started.

3. Refer to the [API Endpoints](#api-endpoints) section for a list of available routes and their functionality.
